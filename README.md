# Challenges
### Storing Friendships in the Database

I decided to create a separate table to store friendships after a confirmed friend request. A friendship between user A and user B would be stored as a record in the table, but I was not sure if I should create another record to represent the friendship in the other direction.

I went with creating two records per friendship despite the redundancy for a couple of reasons. First, I can use the query ```user.friends``` to retrive a list of friends for a particular user by leveraging Active Record associations. There would be no need to chain query methods or write raw SQL to perform the same task. As a result, the code is cleaner and easier to understand.

```
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :friendships, dependent: :destroy
  has_many :friends, through: :friendships
end

class Friendship < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
  belongs_to :friend, class_name: 'User'
end
```
Second, although friendships are mutual, each individual may view friendships differently than their counterpart. For example, User A may treat User B as a casual friend while User B sees User A as a close friend. This difference in perspective can be stored as a separate attribute for each record. Storing two records per friendship means that we can model the difference in perspective between two individuals.
